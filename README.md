## Cryptocurrencies
Use unsupervised machine learning techniques to analyze cryptocurrency data.

## Project Overview
Fictional investment bank, Accountability Accounting, is interested in offering a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio to its clients; however, the company needs assistance in determining which cryptocurrencies they should offer. Senior management has requested a report that include what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and if they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment.

The data from Accountability Accounting needed to be cleaned in order to fit the machine learning models, and since there isn't a known output for what this investment bank is looking for, unsupervised machine learning was employed. In order to group the cryptocurrencies, a clustering algorithm was utilized and the data was visualized so the finding could be shared with the board.

## Steps included in this project:

- Data Preprocessing (Selection, Transformation, Scaling) - the process of helping to prepare data for Machine Learning Algorithms.
- Elbow Curve - method to determine the best number of clusters needed for the algorithm to group the objects by.

- Principal Component Analysis (PCA) - statistical technique to speed up machine learning algorithms when the number of features is too high.
- Clustering Algorithms (KMeans) - the process of grouping similar objects/data points into clusters.
- Visualization (hvPlot, Plotly) - graphic libraries that allows us to create 2D and 3D graphs such as, scatter plots.
